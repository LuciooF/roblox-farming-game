# Core Gameplay Loop

## 1. Join the Game
Player spawns on a small farm with a few plots and basic seeds.

A simple tutorial guides the player through planting, watering, and harvesting.

## 2. Planting Phase
Players select seeds and plant them in available plots.

Each seed type has unique attributes:
- Growth rate (e.g., 1 wheat per hour)
- Sell value
- Watering frequency
- Weather sensitivity

## 3. Growth Phase
Crops generate yield over time, even while the player is offline.

Production rate:
- Offline: Normal speed
- Online: Double speed (100% growth boost)

Watering:
- Watering crops regularly maintains optimal growth.
- If left unwatered for too long, crops produce at a reduced rate.
- Crops do not die while the player is offline, but productivity suffers without water.

## 4. Weather System
A rotating global weather system affects crop growth.

Example weather types:
- Sunny: Certain crops grow faster
- Rainy: No need to water
- Cloudy: Neutral effect
- Thunderstorm: Risk of crop damage

Players can check a forecast showing upcoming weather changes.

## 5. Crop Protection with Roofs
Thunderstorms can damage or reset crop progress.

Players can build "roofs" over specific plots to prevent weather-related damage.

Roofs offer no speed bonus but ensure safety during storms.

## 6. Harvesting and Selling
Players harvest crops once ready or once yield has accumulated.

Collected crops are sold for money.

Each crop has a storage cap (e.g., 100 units), encouraging frequent returns or automation.

## 7. Spending and Expansion
Money is used to:
- Buy better seeds with higher rewards and complexity
- Unlock additional plots
- Upgrade tools (e.g., better watering cans)
- Build more roofs for storm protection

## 8. Progression and Rebirths
After reaching specific milestones (e.g., total money earned or crops harvested), players can choose to rebirth.

Rebirthing resets the farm but gives permanent benefits such as:
- Sale price multipliers
- Access to higher-tier seeds
- Weather resistance perks
